# Note on missing data in repo:

The data used on this report numbered over 30,000,000 rows and several
gigabytes of data. That said, I am unable to push the raw data. One of the files
used, `total_death_data.csv` is included, as are all scripts used to clean and
prep the data. In-report hyperlinks point to the websites from which raw data
can be sourced, but raw files were put into folders specifies in the cleaning
scripts. Duplicating the folder structure would be required for full
reproduction of results.
